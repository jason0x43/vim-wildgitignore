# vim-wildgitignore

This plugin just turns gitignore rules into vim wildignore rules. It processes gitinore files in a similar fashion to (ideally the same as) git. The initial goal for this plugin is to improve NERDTree's ability to ignore gitignored files by setting wildignore properly.

## Installation

Install like any other plugin (e.g., `Plug 'jason0x43/vim-wildgitignore'` with vim-plug).

## Configuration

There aren't any options. The plugin simply does what it does.

## credits

This plugin is based on [RootIgnore](https://github.com/octref/RootIgnor://github.com/octref/RootIgnore).
